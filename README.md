# VRplanning
A repository for developing a simple VR planning app on alt-space VR.
Hey guys, I am doing a design masters research project around collaboration in virtual spaces, and wondering how difficult it might be to create something like an 'evidence wall' in VR where people can add text boxes and draw lines between them. Perhaps something like this http://gojs.net/latest/samples/mindMap.html 

Been reading up on the APK and will start playing around soon, have made a github here. There's some drawings here. I am wanting to enter a design competition (here - https://globalchallenges.org/en) to design a better framework for the global community to tackle long term risks like poverty and climate change, I'll hopefully be able to make it to the colloqueum event on wednesday to learn more about other people's ideas for how to use VR for sustainability. I've some experience in html and computer modelling, some of my work is here -> callumnash.com. The ultimate version of what I am thinking would allow you to pull web content from these text box 'post it notes' and contain a 3d worldmap which allows you to superimpose different data like buckminster fuller's world game centre! haha. But for now just adding some text would be fine! Any advice you might have would be brilliant and if you know of anything out there that's similar do let me know.
